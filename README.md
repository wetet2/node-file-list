# simple-web-explorer
This is a reponsive web file explorer on NodeJS with Express such as IIS Directory search.  
I made this for sharing files on my system.
It's very easy and convenient for coworkers to check my files  


``` npm install yarn -g && yarn install ```

then copy server/config.default.js to config.js in the same folder and modify config.js with your information.

To start,

``` yarn start ```
